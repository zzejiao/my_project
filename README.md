## 📌 **Introduction **  
Welcome to my **Personal Side Projects Archive**! 🎨💡 This repository contains a collection of my personal projects, categorized as follows:  

- **🆕 Current Year Projects (2025)** – Organized by themes and actively maintained.  
- **📂 Past Year Projects (2023)** – Archived and sorted chronologically by year.

These projects reflect my journey in learning, experimenting, and building cool stuff. Feel free to explore, learn, and use any part of the code.

Some of the project folder might contains some starter code. This means that they're my goal and I'm still working on them slowly!
